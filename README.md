Description:
This dashboard presents survey results from 768 participants, 268 of whom are patients, with 65.1% recorded as having diabetes. Diabetes shows a strong correlation with glucose levels and BMIâ€”the higher they are, the greater the risk of diabetes. The results also conclude that diabetes can affect individuals during their productive years, with the largest population of diabetic patients being 25, 29, 31, 41, and 22 years old.
